[Beta] [Script] Program Loop complete resolution script.
- Made for the resolution way described in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzWZJ3kdvCtK6i0bT83kyNK1Wydrs3fvI52vVuCKiGM/edit
- Brightly displays tethers; correctly taken tethers display AOE and display in green colors. 
- Displays when you have to take tether or tower
- Explicitly highlights your designated tower at a time when you need to take it; you can configure it to be CW or CCW in settings; swap partner supported - configure name of your partner and if you have same debuff as they do - your direction will be reversed;
- Script is not too well tested. Pay attention to the mechanic yourself as well, and report bugs. 
- There are more features planned to be added into script.
Requires Splatoon v.3.2.0.6 or higher.
